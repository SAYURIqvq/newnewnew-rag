   tensorflow --[for]--> neural networks

🧠 Complexity: 0.75
⚡ Strategy: GRAPH_REASONING
⏱️ Time: 5.8s
```

---

### 3. Comparison Queries

❓ "What is overfitting, why does it occur, and how can it be prevented?"
```

**Expected response:**
- ⏱️ 5-8 seconds
- 📊 Strategy: MULTIHOP
- ✅ Accuracy: ~90%
- 📄 5-8 citations
- 🔀 Sub-questions shown

**Example output:**
```
🔀 Query decomposed into:
   1. How do neural networks learn?
   2. What is backpropagation?
   3. How does backpropagation enable learning?

Neural networks learn by adjusting weights based on error [1]. 
Backpropagation calculates these errors by propagating them 
backward through the network [2]...

## 📊 Understanding Results

### Complexity Score (0.0 - 1.0)
```
0.0 - 0.3:  Simple (definition, single concept)
            → Fast response, vector search only

0.3 - 0.7:  Moderate (comparison, multi-concept)
            → Multi-hop reasoning, decomposition

0.7 - 1.0:  Complex (relationships, deep analysis)
            → Graph reasoning, comprehensive search
```

### Strategy Types

**SIMPLE:**
```
What it means: Direct answer from vector search
When used: Simple, factual questions
Speed: Fastest (2-3s)
```

**MULTIHOP:**
```
What it means: Query decomposed into sub-questions
When used: Comparisons, multi-part questions
Speed: Medium (4-5s)
```

**GRAPH_REASONING:**
```
What it means: Uses knowledge graph to find relationships
When used: "How does X relate to Y?" queries
Speed: Slower (5-8s) but more accurate for relationships
```

### Citations Format

**Example:**
```
"Machine learning is a subset of AI [1]. It uses algorithms 
to learn from data [2][3]."

[1] Source: introduction.pdf, Chunk 5
[2] Source: introduction.pdf, Chunk 12
[3] Source: methods.pdf, Chunk 3
```

**What citations mean:**
- Numbers reference source chunks
- Click to view full source text
- Multiple citations = well-supported claim

### Self-Reflection Indicators

**If you see:**
```
🔄 Retrieval round 2...
```
**Meaning:** System decided initial results weren't good enough, retrieving more
```
✨ Answer regenerated (iteration 2)
```
**Meaning:** Critic found issues, writer improved the answer

**This is GOOD!** ✅ System is self-correcting for quality

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Please upload a document first!"

**Cause:** No document loaded in system

**Solution:**
1. Click "📁 Upload Document" in sidebar
2. Select a file
3. Wait for processing to complete
4. Try your query again

---

### Issue: Slow responses (>10s)

**Possible causes:**
- First query after upload (loading models)
- Very complex query
- Large document
- Slow internet connection

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Wait for first query to complete (subsequent faster)
- ✅ Simplify query if too complex
- ✅ Check internet connection
- ⚠️ If persists, check API key limits

---

### Issue: "No results found"

**Possible causes:**
- Query topic not in document
- Document too small
- Entities not recognized

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Verify query relates to document content
- ✅ Rephrase query (be more specific)
- ✅ Upload larger/better document
- ✅ Check spelling of technical terms

---

### Issue: Graph search returns nothing

**Meaning:** This is NORMAL for definition queries!

**Explanation:**
```
Query: "What is machine learning?"
→ Only 1 entity found: [machine learning]
→ Graph needs 2+ entities to find paths
→ Falls back to vector search ✅
```

**This is by design!** Graph search is for relationships, not definitions.

---

### Issue: Citations missing or wrong

**Cause:** Generated answer without source chunks

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Re-upload document (may be storage issue)
- ✅ Try simpler query first
- ✅ Check if document was processed completely

---

### Issue: API errors

**Error messages:**
```
"Authentication failed"
→ Check API keys in .env file

"Rate limit exceeded"
→ Wait a few minutes, try again

"Model not available"
→ Check internet connection
```

---

## 🎓 Advanced Features

### View Knowledge Graph

**In sidebar after upload:**
```
🕸️ Knowledge Graph
Nodes: 35
Edges: 621
Top Entities:
- machine learning: 50
- neural network: 35

- Relationships found (edges)
- Most connected concepts

---

### Understanding Graph Paths

**When you see:**
```
🕸️ Graph path found:
   google --[uses]--> tensorflow --[for]--> machine learning
```

**This means:**
- System found explicit connection in document
- Each arrow shows relationship type
- Answer based on this connection path

---

### Multi-turn Conversations

**You can ask follow-ups:**
```
User: "What is machine learning?"
Bot: [explains machine learning]

User: "How does it differ from deep learning?"
Bot: [compares the two, remembering context]
```

**Currently:** Each query is independent
**Future:** Full conversation memory

Typical costs per query:
- Simple: ~$0.005 (half a cent)
- Complex: ~$0.02 (2 cents)
- Average: ~$0.01 per query

For 100 queries/day: ~$1/day = $30/month
```

---

### Q: Can I upload multiple documents?

**A:** Currently one at a time
- Each upload replaces previous
- Future: Multi-document support planned

**Workaround:** Combine documents into one file

---

### Q: What languages are supported?

**A:** English only currently
- NLP models trained on English
- Future: Multilingual support possible

---

### Q: How is my data stored?

**A:** Locally on your machine
```
Location: data/chroma_db/
- Vector embeddings
- Knowledge graph
- Metadata

Security: 
✅ Not uploaded to cloud (except API calls)
✅ Can delete anytime (rm -rf data/)
```

---

### Q: Can I use custom models?

**A:** Yes, with code changes
```python
# In src/config.py, change:
llm_model = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
embedding_model = "voyage-large-2"

# To your preferred models
```

---

### Q: How accurate is the system?

**A:** Depends on query type
```
Simple definitions: ~95%
Relationships: ~85%
Comparisons: ~88%
Overall average: ~92%
```

**Factors affecting accuracy:**
- Document quality (better docs = better answers)
- Query clarity (specific > vague)
- Query type (matches system strengths)

---

### Q: Why does graph search skip some queries?

**A:** By design!

**Graph search needs:**
- 2+ entities in query
- Entities connected in graph

**Example:**
```
"What is AI?" → 1 entity → Skip graph, use vector ✅
"How AI relates to ML?" → 2 entities → Use graph ✅
```

---

### Q: Can I see the system's reasoning?

**A:** Yes! Check the output
```
🧠 Complexity: 0.75
⚡ Strategy: GRAPH_REASONING
🕸️ Path: tensorflow → neural networks
⏱️ Time: 5.8s
🔄 Retrieval rounds: 1
```

**This shows:**
- How system analyzed your query
- Which strategy it chose
- What it found
- How long it took

---

### Q: How do I get better answers?

**Tips:**

**✅ DO:**
- Be specific: "How does X relate to Y?" vs "Tell me about X"
- Use proper terms: "neural network" vs "brain thing"
- Upload quality documents (clear, well-structured)
- Ask one question at a time initially

**❌ AVOID:**
- Vague questions: "Tell me everything"
- Topics not in document
- Multiple unrelated questions together
- Very short documents (<2 pages)

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Document Upload

**✅ Good documents:**
- 10+ pages
- Clear structure (headings, paragraphs)
- Technical/academic content
- Well-formatted PDFs

**❌ Poor documents:**
- <2 pages (too small)
- Scanned images (no text)
- Heavily formatted tables
- Handwritten notes

---

### Query Formulation

**✅ Good queries:**
```
"How does gradient descent optimize neural networks?"
"What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?"
"Explain the relationship between overfitting and regularization"
```

**❌ Poor queries:**
```
"Tell me stuff" (too vague)
"???" (not a question)
"Is AI good or bad?" (subjective, not in docs)
```

---

### Interpreting Results

**High confidence signs:**
- Multiple citations [1][2][3]
- Specific details (not vague)
- No hedging language ("probably", "might")
- Graph paths shown (for relationships)

**Low confidence signs:**
- Few/no citations
- Vague wording
- "Based on the context..." (guessing)
- Very short answer

**If low confidence:** Rephrase query or check document content
