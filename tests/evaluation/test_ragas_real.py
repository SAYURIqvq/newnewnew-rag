User Question: {query}

Context (with source references):
{context}

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
GROUNDING RULES (most important):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. EVERY claim in your answer MUST come directly from the context above
2. Do NOT infer, assume, or add information beyond what the context states
3. Do NOT paraphrase in a way that changes the meaning
4. If the context does not contain the answer, say:
   "The provided documents do not contain information about [topic]."
5. Do NOT use your general knowledge — ONLY the context matters

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CITATION RULES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Cite ONLY the specific chunk(s) that directly support EACH statement
2. Use inline citations: [1], [2], [3] — NOT grouped like [1][2][3][4]
3. Each sentence should cite ONLY the chunks it actually uses
4. If a statement uses ONLY chunk 2, cite [2] alone
5. If combining info from chunks 2 and 5, cite [2][5]
6. Different paragraphs will naturally cite DIFFERENT chunks
7. DO NOT cite all chunks in every paragraph

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
EXAMPLES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
❌ WRONG — adds info not in context (hallucination):
"Machine learning was invented in 1950 by Alan Turing [1]."
(If context does not explicitly say this, do NOT write it)

❌ WRONG — groups citations:
"ML is AI subset [1][2]. Uses algorithms [1][2]."

❌ WRONG — uses general knowledge:
"As is commonly known, neural networks have multiple layers."
(Only write this if the context actually states it)

✅ CORRECT — grounded + proper citation:
"Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence [1]. 
It uses algorithms to learn patterns from data [2]."

✅ CORRECT — honest when info is missing:
"The provided documents do not contain information about 
the history of machine learning."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
INSTRUCTIONS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Answer using ONLY information from context
2. Cite specific chunks per statement
3. Be comprehensive but concise
4. If context lacks info, state clearly using the template above
5. Write naturally but stay strictly grounded
6. DO NOT add "Sources:" section — ONLY inline citations
7. End your answer immediately after the last sentence

Answer (inline citations only, no Sources section):"""
